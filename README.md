# Spring Security + JWT (Spring 6.0)
This is the final implementation of Spring Security + JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authorization and authentication. This will be used as an __integration__ for future projects, and to be configured accordingly based on the requirements.
> Note: If you plan on upgrading JDK version, check the [official documentation](https://spring.io/) for changes in the configurations.
